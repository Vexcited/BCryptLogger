# BCryptLogger

> Only for Windows.

## Usage

Compile into a `.dll` and drop the `bcrypt.dll` into the directory of the program you want to log.

Make sure to have a directory at `C:\bcryptlogger` created because the logs will be saved as `logs.txt` in that directory.
It might crash if the directory doesn't exist.
